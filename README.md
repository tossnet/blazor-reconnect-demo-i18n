## Overview

This project demonstrates how to customize the **Reconnection UI component** introduced in the Blazor Web App template (starting with .NET 10). It also includes a practical approach to **localizing UI elements**, making the reconnection experience adaptable to multilingual audiences.

Whether you're building a global-facing application or simply want more control over the reconnection flow, this example shows how to:

- Personalize the reconnection interface with custom styles and behavior.
- Integrate basic translation logic using JavaScript.

## Use Case

Ideal for developers who want to:

- Improve user experience during transient connection loss.
- Offer reconnection feedback in multiple languages.
- Ensure compliance with stricter CSP environments.
- Explore Blazor's new UI capabilities with practical enhancements.
